This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked HTML/JavaScript error: attempting to modify the innerHTML property of an element that does not exist. The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, leading to a silent failure where the intended text does not appear. The bugSolution.html file presents the correct approach, ensuring that the element is available before modification.  This subtle error can be difficult to debug, as it does not generate a console error, but simply fails silently.
